This is a project I've completed in a few hours, on Feb 14, 2023. It was a very fun activity, especially after years of not writing any SQL code! 

Unfortunately, I didn't save the schema of the project; it was one of my major complains regarding it. I would have designed the schema in a different way, which, in turn, would have made all the queries more efficient.
