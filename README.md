# Lego Sets Popularity - Competion organized on [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com)

This is a project I've completed in a few hours, on Feb 14, 2023. It was a very fun activity, especially after years of not writing any SQL code! 

Unfortunately, I didn't save the schema of the project; it was one of my major complains regarding it. I would have designed the schema in a different way, which, in turn, would have made all the queries more efficient.

## Note:

Some of the cells in the Jupyter notebook are not rendered properly outside of the DataCamp Workspace. I didn't have time to explore the issue, yet.

The project can be visualized on the DataCamp platform: [RamonaCTruta_Competition-LegoSets](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/43f8631a-4651-431e-b606-196200f87562)
